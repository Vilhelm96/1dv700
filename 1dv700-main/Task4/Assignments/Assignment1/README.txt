To make the program to work you need to either use a pre created text file with a message or
you create your own message.
Some pre created text files will be included.

Steps to run the program.
1. Start program
2. Choose either substitution or transposition
3. Choose to encrypt or decrypt
4.1. If substitution write in the text file with the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
4.2. If transposition write a key and then the text file you want to encrypt or decrypt.
5. Repeat from step 1-4 until you are done and then you can exit the program from main menu.
